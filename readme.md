# Avatar Customizer

## Built for use in [Mozilla Hubs](https://hubs.mozilla.com/)
(which means don't yell at me if your avatar isn't compatible with other platforms, I'm working on it)

## 🌞💞Powered by love, being out of college, and solar energy!💞🌞
This V2 has been a long time coming. The original version was written while I was still in undergrad working with [Augmented Environments Lab](https://gvu.gatech.edu/research/labs/augmented-environments-lab) at Georgia Tech. While I'm very proud I got V1 up and running in time for the IEEE VR 2020 conference, the backend was definitely a complete mess. 

Happy to say it is now, at the very least, less of a mess, and at the very MOST it will now be much easier for me the add more content. (Now that I don't have to hack through the thickets of spaghetti code with a machete)

## Show me stuff!! 📷 🥺👉👈
If you fork this project and add some cool stuff, have a really cute screenshot of you using your avatar, anything like that, please tag/DM me on Twitter or drop me an email!
